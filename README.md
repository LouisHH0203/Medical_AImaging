This was my final group project at my le wagon boot camp! Using the skills we learned we have creaetd a website that takes an MRI or CT scan image which allows us to diagnose parts of our body with several diseases.

The website would take an uploaded png and go through three neural net work models

1. A home-brewed sequential classifcation model to detect organs
2. A binary classfication VGG16 model to be able to detect diseases
3. A multi-class VGG16 model which detetcs whcih disease is present in the organs
